And who you might want to work with so you said one should pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people why. Yeah this is an insight into what makes silicon valley work and what makes high trust societies work essentially all the benefits in life come from compound interest whether it's in relationships or making money or in learning. So come on interest is a marvelous force where it's like you start out with one x what you have and then if you increase twenty percent a year for thirty years it's not that you got. Thirty years times twenty percent added on it was compounding so just grew and grew and grew until you suddenly got a massive amount of whatever it is whether it's goodwill or love relationships or money. I think compound interest is very important for you have to play a long term game and long term games are good not just for compound interest also good for trust if you look at prisoners dilemma type games solution to prisoners dilemma is tip for tap which is i'm just gonna do to you what you did last time to me with some forgiveness in case there was a mistake made. But that only works and it really doesn't present the letter in other words we play the game multiple times so if you're in a situation like for example you're in silicon valley what people doing business with each other and they know each other they trust each other then they do right by each other because they know this person will be around for the next game not of course that doesn't always work because you can make so much money in one move in silicon valley sometimes people betray each other because they're just like i'm gonna get rich enough about this that i don't care so there can be exceptions to all the circumstances what essentially if you want to be successful you have to work with other people and you have to figure out who can you trust and who can you trust over a long long period of time that you can just keep playing the game with them so that compound interest in high trust will make it easy to play the game and will let you collect the major rewards which are usually at the end of the cycle so for example one buffett done really well as an investor in the us stock market what the biggest reason you can do that was because the us stock market has been stable and around and didn't get for example sees by the government during a bad administration or the us didn't plunged some war the underlying platform didn't get destroyed so in his case is playing a long term game and the trust came from the us stock market stability in silicon valley the trust comes from the network of people in the small geographic area that you figure out over time we can work with you can if you keep switching locations keep switching groups let's say you started out in the woodworking industry and you build up a network there and you're working hard you're trying to build a product would work industry and suddenly another industry comes along that's adjacent but different but you don't really know anybody in it and you wanna dive in and make money there if you keep hopping from industry no actually need to open a line of electric car stations for electric car refueling that might make sense it might be the best opportunity but every time you reset every time you wonder out of where you built your network you're gonna be starting from scratch you're not gonna know who to trust they're not gonna trust you they're also industries in which people are transient by definition to always coming in and going out politics example of that right in politics new people are being elected you see in politics that when you have a lot of old timers like the senate people been around for a long time and they've been clear politicians what a downside to your politics that corruption but upside is they actually get deals done with each other because they know the other person's gonna be the same position ten years from now and they got to keep dealing with them so they might as well learn how to cooperate where's every time you get like a new incoming freshman class in the house of representatives which turns over every two years the big wave election nothing gets done because a lot of fighting because i just got here i don't know you i don't know if you're gonna be around why should i work with you rather than just trying to do whatever i think is right so it's important to pick an industry where you can play long term games and with long term people so those people have to signal that they're gonna be around for a long time that they're ethical and their ethics are visible to their action. In a long term game it seems that everybody is making each other rich and in a short term game it seems like everybody's making themselves rich. I think that is a brilliant formulation yet in a long term game it's positive some we're all baking together we're trying to make it as big as possible in a short term game we're cutting up the pie now this is not to excuse the socialists right the social people who are not involved in baking the pie and show up at the end and say i want to slice or i want the whole pie show up with the guns but i think a good leader doesn't take credit a good leader tries to inspire people so the team get the job done and then things get divided up according to fairness and who contributed how much or as close to as possible and took a risk as opposed to just whoever has the longest knife the sharpest knives at the end. So these next two tweets are play iterated games all returns in life whether in wealth relationships or knowledge come from compound interest. Yeah when you've been doing business with somebody to be friends with somebody for ten years twenty years thirty years it just gets better and better because you trust them so easy the friction goes down you can do bigger and bigger things together for example you know simplest one is getting married to someone having kids and raising children like that's compound interest rate investing in those relationships those relations and the pain, invaluable compared to more casual relationships it's true and health and fitness you know the better you are the easier to stay fit where's the more deteriorate your body the harder to come back and call your way back to a baseline requires heroic acts. Regarding compound interest i think i saw you retweet something a while back maybe was from ed, add more it was something along the lines of get some traction get purchase and don't lose it so the idea was to gain some initial traction and never fall back just keep ratcheting up and up. I don't remember exactly but i think that was right i was like get traction and don't let go it was a good one yeah. In terms of people to work with that have high intelligence energy and integrity i find that's the three part checklist that you cannot compromise on you need someone who's smart or the heading in the wrong direction and you're not gonna end up in the right place you need someone high energy because the world is full of smart lazy people we all know people are really smart but you can't get out of bed or left the finger. We also know people who are very high energy but not that smart to be work hard but the running in the wrong direction and smart it's not a project it's not meant to be like, someone smart someone else is stupid but it's more than everyone smart different things so depending on what you want to do well you have to find someone who's smart at that thing. And then energy lot of times people are unmotivated for specific thing but they're not motivated for other things for example someone might be really unmotivated to go to a job and sit in an office but they might be really motivated to go paint right on that case, should be a painter this should be putting up a minute trying to figure out how to build a career out of that rather than wearing a collar around their neck and going to a job and then, hi integrity the most important because otherwise you got the other two what you have is you have a smart and hard working crook who's eventually gonna cheat you, so you have to figure out the person's high integrity as we talked about the way you do that is the signals and signals is what they do not what they say it's all the nonverbal stuff that people do when they think nobody's looking. With respect to the energy there is this interesting thing from sam altman a while back where he was talking about delegation and even saying one of the important things for delegation is delegate to people who are actually good at the thing that you want them to do. It's the most obvious thing but it seems like you wanna partner with people who are naturally going to do the things that you want them to do. Yeah i almost won't start a company or hire a person to work with somebody if i just don't think they're into what i want to do. When i was younger i used to try and talk people in the things i was idea you can sell someone into doing something but you can't you can't keep the motivated you can get them inspired initially it might work if you're a king like him with a fifth try to get them to charge in the battle and then they'll figure it out but if you try to keep someone motivated for the long term that motivation has to come intrinsically, you can't just create it nor can you be the crutch for them if they don't have that intrinsic motivation so you have to make sure people actually are high energy and what i do what you want them to do what you want to work with them. Reading signals is very very important signals are what people do despite what they say, so it's important to pay attention to subtle signals we all know the socially if someone treats a waiter waitress in a restaurant we badly then it's only a matter of time until they treat you badly if somebody screws over an enemy and is vindictive to where is them well it's only a matter of time before they redefine you from friend to enemy and you feel that so angry outrage vindictive short term thinking people are essentially that way in, many interactions middle life people are oddly consistent when things you learn about them so you wanna find long term people you wanna find people who seem irrationally ethical example i had one friend of mine was company i invested in and the company failed and you could have wiped out all the investors but he kept putting more and more personal money and three different pivots you put personal money and until the company finally succeeded and in the process you never wiped out the investors. And i was always grateful to him for that i said like what's amazing that you know you are so good to investors you can wipe them out and he got offended by that he said i didn't do it for you i didn't do it for my best friend i did it for me it's my own self esteem it's what i care about that's how i live my life that's the kind of person you wanna work with. Another quote that i like i would tweet on this figure read this somewhere else recently so i'm not taking credit for this but i modified a little bit which is that self esteem is a reputation that you have with yourself, you always know so good people moral people ethical people easy to work with people reliable people tend to have very high self esteem because they have very good reputation with themselves and they understand that it's not ego self esteem ego different things ego can be undeserved but self esteem at least you feel like you live up to your own internal moral code of ethics and it's very hard to work with people who end up being low integrity that is hard to figure out who's high integrity low integrity generally the more someone is saying that their moral and ethical and high integrity the less likely there to be that way it's very much like status signaling, if you over the bed for status if you overly talk about being high status that is a low status if you openly talk about how honest and reliable and trustworthy you are you're probably not that honest and trustworthy that is a characteristic of con men, so yeah picking an industry.
